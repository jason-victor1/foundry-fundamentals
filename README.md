# Foundry Fundamentals

I acquired the skills needed to start developing my smart contracts and protocols using the best web3 development tools and frameworks like Chainlink, Alchemy, and Foundry.

## Overview of Foundry
Foundry is a smart contract development framework known for its efficiency and modularity. It manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the blockchain from the command line and via Solidity scripts.

### Advantages of Foundry
- **Rust Compilation**: Leverages Rust for compilation which offers significantly faster build times compared to frameworks like Hardhat or Brownie.
- **Solidity-Based**: Entirely Solidity-based, eliminating the need to learn other programming languages.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provides extensive documentation, making it easier to understand and use.

### Development Tools
I used Visual Studio Code to write, test, deploy, and interact with smart contracts. Visual Studio Code is a versatile code editor that integrates well with Foundry and other web3 development tools.

I was able to efficiently develop and manage smart contracts and protocols by utilizing these tools and frameworks.
